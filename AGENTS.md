## Development Environment
- Use Python 3.11 or newer.
- Install dependencies with the optional extras to run tests and the web server:

  ```
- Run the full test suite with coverage:
  ```bash
  coverage run --source=catanatron -m pytest tests/ && coverage report
  ```
- The frontend lives in `ui/` and requires Node.js `$(cat ui/.nvmrc)` (currently 24). Install dependencies and run tests with:

  ```
